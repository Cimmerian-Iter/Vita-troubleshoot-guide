People Hack their vita for various reason, it can be to enjoy the great world of emulations, like doing some rampage in GTA, race with Gran turismo or have some action packed game like Pursuit Force. Going nostalgic and play the original Sonic games, Mario games and play Metal Slug and arcades game.

They can also hack it so they can hack their games, use mods to improve the experience. Like fant translation, Season update like FIFA 20, or asset swap.

More generally, they try to uncover the full potential of the PSVita by modding it, using plugins to enhance the PSVita performance with overclocking, avoid getting their eyes burned with vitabright. Download files from the web browser or using microsd in order to save tousands of bucks for a large storage.  
Playing PC port on PSVita or stream PC games with moonlight.

Credit : I want to thanks this awesome community for the good memories i was able to make. Watching it grow from the start in 2016 to what it is today.   
To have met different kind of people, whenever it's a simple end user asking for my help, or good buddies i was able to make like some CBPS members \(Dots TB, coderx, silica, caghandemir\) or SKGleba with who i really enjoyed testing his stuff and beating him in PUBG or Killzone ;\)   
Thanks to those people i was able to learn a lot about the PSVita and it's software mecanism. How the hacks works. I was able to make myself a good knowledge about it that i can share with the end users and help them on whatever problems they have.   
It also gave me the opportunity to speak to high figures of the hacks like Dave, Yfanlu, xyz, TheFlow something i had never imagined to do during the PSP era when i was merely a end user.   
This is why i devote myself to help users, because i want them to enjoy the PSVita as much as i love it \(and they also donated to me 80$ so i can buy a new vita after i bricked mine while doing some test. As a thanks for what i have done for them\).   
Because it is usually hard to get some help when people doesn't respect you or make fun of you because you're a noob, or when you don't find anywhere the answer for your question, i wanted to change all of this. And thanks to the help of friends like me who enjoy helping people \(God Ginrai, Tyke, Kasha, Phil, Megugao, and Xcorra when he was still there\). They also supported me while doing this guide and gave me some hints.   
And thanks to PipeWarp, a user who i helped to unbrick his vita and became my friend. He gave me the screenshot, set up the github page as an alternative to this Gitbook and proof read the guide to avoid the eyes of native english speaker to burn because of the existence of some grammar errors. We have offered the best kind of help service i was dreaming of providing to the community in the henkaku server. And this is the reason i created this troubleshooting Guide. Which i aim to update it to make it more complete, like including a game mode section, or a vitacheat section. And some other stuff if you want me to add.


If you ever want to thank me for the guide, drop a message to the discord or in Twitter im always happy to see that what i do is useful for people.Also please suscribe to my patreon.  
\(Joking i don't have a patreon and i don't do that for money. But if you ever want to buy me a cup of oange juice, you can donate to my Paypal if you feel generous enough : samilops2@gmail.com\)
