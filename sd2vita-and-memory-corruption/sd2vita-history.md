# SD2VITA history

Back then, we had two solutions. Either you buy a PSVita 3G and swap the 3G antenna with a psvsd to use a MicroSD, or else you destroy your wallet on amazon to order a memory card. We kinda lost hope, or not. We begged yfanlu to find a solution, but it was xyz who managed to find a solution to use a MicroSD on any PSVita, without opening the vita nor any modification of any kind.\
\
And thus the SD2Vita was born.



## The prototype

Using the cartridge slot wasn't the first attempt, we had before the black fin cobra dongle which used the cartridge slot to communicate with the pc to share games on a placeholder.

![Weeee hacker stuff, seems like somthing from the Matrix](<../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

But using the cartridge slot as a memory card slot was made possible thanks to xyz. Devkit and Prototype vita could use a regular SD card, so there was a driver for that for the vita. The idea was to hook that driver to the cartridge slot, and create an adapter that connects the MicroSD pin to the cartridge slot pin. Since a PSVita cartridge was just an SD card with authentification.\
\
And thus was born the prototype, with the effort of xyz and motoharu who worked on reversing anything that has to do with memory card protocol, they made the first SD2Vita.

{% endembed %}

But as you can see, it wasn't as simple as installing a plugin, the process of loading the SD2Vita was not yet complete. And they had no plan on producing these like before where yfanlu sold the psvsd.

## The first version

The work was done, gamesd.skprx was released and the race had begun ! Xyz published the blueprint of the SD2Vita so anyone with PCB, soldering tools could create their own SD2Vita ! Although the one produced now doesn't use xyz blueprint but Gadorach version.

Those were cheap to produce, and many people from the scene wanted to do their own so we had different variants of the sd2vita .

![The most popular one](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)

![Made by our french producer srident !](<../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

![Gadorach version](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

![Cpasjuste version, mostly known around logic sunrise members](<../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png>)

The first one was only PCB, and it had a major advantage which is the MicroSD push to eject system which makes it easy to insert and remove the MicroSD.\
The same can't be said about removing the sd2vita from the vita, as you can see it's barebone, so there's no PCB that handles the eject mechanism of the cartridge slot. So you insert the sd2vita annnd, good luck removing it.&#x20;

Most people just left the sd2vita inside the vita, and thanks to the push mechanism of the SD2Vita they could easily access it even if the sd2vita was blocked inside the vita.&#x20;

Then again some people found some tricks, the first one was to grab one of the sides of the SD2Vita with that tool, and remove it like a horn on your toe.

![Your best vita companion ](<../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png>)

The problem is that removing the sd2vita with that was still tricky, while it worked, it could damage both the sd2vita PCB and the cartridge slot. Mine suffered enough with that one.

The second solution was to put some tape on the sd2vita that came off the cartridge slot so you can pull on the tape, which will bring the sd2vita outside the cartridge slot. So far that was the best solution.



Oh yeah and I forgot to mention something.

**It cost 15€**

I don't really know who decided to put that price, especially since buying a soldering kit + PCB wasn't that costly and the demand was high. But then again it's because the demand was high and it was a small price to pay for salvation compared to sony memory card prices.



The one I showed you were the most popular and the most RELIABLE.

One problem with that kind of SD2Vita is that if the build quality was messed up it could turn off your PSVita if you plugged the SD2Vita in. Because it would create a short circuit.



## The second version

So as I said, removing the sd2vita would be tricky, so a V2 was made. It's the same as the V1 but with an extra PCB layer that would handle the push to eject mechanism of the PSVita.\


![Oh god oh fuck that smile it scares me](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

It was a nice idea, frankly. And it would have met its success if it wasn't for the bad quality of the whole thing. It keeps catching the springs when trying to pop out of the cartridge slot which damaged the slot, and they were less reliable meaning there was a higher chance of your vita being powered off after inserting that one. It was kind of a disaster and was shortly not recommended.

## The third version

With the V2 failure, people still tried to find a way to make a sd2vita that can use the push to eject mechanism. And Gadorach, who made one of the first versions of the SD2Vita, had an idea in mind. Let's forget about using PCB and replicate a real vita cartridge.

HackInformer decided to team up with Gadorach in order to create those sd2vita (alongside having the exclusivity of selling those.

So the SD2vita Plus project was born

![The super SD2Vita project, better than anything, stronger than anyone and scammier than VitaDock !](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

It was supposed to be a premium product and it was its main selling point when compared to the V2. But unfortunately, their money hunger was stronger than their abilities and the project was a failure. They put a launch date without even being sure that it would be successfully made, and they took pre order.

![Wait what's that? It's like some sort of silicon teeth with a chip inside](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

The main problem was the plastic which was not quite right, apparently their producer failed them and they had a lot of problems with.

![Feeling down? The SD2Vita Plus too](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)

The failure of the project made Gadorach release the blueprint and China took a hold of them. If anyone can manufacture anything, it's them. No more competition like in the V1 era where anyone could produce those, the market changed. The producer was now China, and the V1 creators began to change into resellers, so anywhere you go, you buy an SD2vita from a reseller, but the product is the same.

And thus officially, the V3 was born :&#x20;

![Sexy](<../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png>)

Wait, it's not red? Mine is red. Which version is it?

The white version had a problem (damn again) : the glue was melting and the SD2Vita was unusable.&#x20;

The red version which is labeled V3.5 (but often labeled V3 as it replaced all the white versions in the market) fix that issue. \
\
It also had a price drop, it wasn't 15€, but around 5-10€ at release. Thanks China !........ Or not, since it's China and it came from one producer and was mass produced, there were a lot of faulty ones produced and sold. And since there were no competitors, there was no alternative. So generally you had to buy another one if the one you got was not working.

## The V5

wait, I did maths at school, I know how to count.

1.....2.......3......4?

Where is the V4?

Well technically the V4 is the V3.5 which is the black and red version. As to who decided how to label those SD2Vita I guess it's the Chinese manufacturer.

Anyway, why did we need a V5? To fix the rate of faulty SD2ita sold? Nope !

The V3 couldn't really fit in a slim PSVita as it was too high, so the cartridge slot couldn't close on slim because the top of the SD2Vita would pop out. This redesign aims to fix that so it can easily fit on slim PSVita.

There's different variations of the SD2vita on the market :

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>) wait compatible what?



All I can say is that we should avoid the SD2Vita which presentation miss MicroSD or Compatible. Not because it's some kind of version, but those tend to have a higher faulty rate. Better find a good reseller who does his job correctly and doesn't just pick an image from google image to showcase his product.



## The V6

Wait what V6? I don't see it anywhere. And why V6?

Well the aim of the V6 was to do some kind of SD2Vita plus, a premium product. So yeah the inside was better made, and the quality of the end product did feel premium compared to the Chinese version, and it was also originally intended to have the push to eject MicroSD mechanism that was left behind starting V3, but the problem was the price. Why buy a SD2Vita V6 for 15-20€ when you can buy a V5 for 2-3€ ?

So it ended up being a total failure and not sold anymore. Which is a shame because the original idea was great.
